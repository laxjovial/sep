    """
    Analyzes the sentiment of a given text and returns a classification (positive, neutral, negative)
    and a score. This tool is useful for understanding the emotional tone of written content.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text to analyze sentiment for.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing 'sentiment' (str) and 'score' (float).
                        Sentiment can be 'positive', 'neutral', or 'negative'.
                        Score is typically between -1.0 (most negative) and 1.0 (most positive).
                        Returns an error message if analysis fails.
